#EOQ Program

#Use Classes and multiple functions with conditionals that will run the problem with different configurations of the formula based on the variables that are "given" (changed from letters).

#Q = sqrt((2*K*D)/h)

# Variables to be marked with "x" to indicate unknown variable

# amount of items per order
Q = "x"

# fixed (setup) cost
K = "x"

# amount demanded items per day
D = "x"

# inventory carrying (holding) cost per unit
h = "x"
